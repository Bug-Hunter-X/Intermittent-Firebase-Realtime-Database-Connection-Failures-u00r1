# Intermittent Firebase Realtime Database Connection Failures

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Firebase Realtime Database where connection failures occur intermittently even when the network connection appears to be fine.  Standard network connectivity checks pass, yet Firebase reports a connection failure. This is a particularly challenging issue to debug due to its intermittent nature.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` offers a solution to mitigate this issue by incorporating more robust error handling and connection monitoring strategies.

## Solution
The provided solution involves exponential backoff retry logic and a more comprehensive error handling approach that accounts for temporary network disruptions and Firebase's specific error messages.
